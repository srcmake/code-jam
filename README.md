# Code Jam Solutions

I'll use this repo to post my solutions to the problems in Google's coding competition, [Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam).

## Normal Template

Typical workflow is:
1. Open Normal Template folder in VSCode.
1. Add the test cases to input.in (copy from problem).
1. Update main.cpp with the solution.
1. Run `make` in terminal to build and run the code.
1. Read the output in output.out
1. Repeat steps 3-5 until solution works.
1. Copy main.cpp code, paste into Code Jam editor in website.
1. Comment out `freopen(filein, "r", stdin); freopen(fileout, "w", stdout);` line.
1. Run solution in website.
